<strong>The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web)</strong> is an information space where documents
and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked
by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet.[1] English scientist Tim Berners-Lee
invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990
while employed at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3] The Web browser was released outside of CERN in 1991,
first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet
in August 1991.<img src = "test_img.png" width = "70%">
